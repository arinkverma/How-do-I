# How-do-I
I developed this for Chandigarh city. App provides information about procedure to get driving license, passport and other important documents. 

**Please note: The verison of this application is a bit different from what was submitted to cDAC.**

## Motivation
* People need to apply for official documents like marriage certificate, birth certificates etc.
* Whole process very tiring.
* No knowledge of needed forms or where to get them.
* A single document equals many round trips to the concerned offices.
* Would be much easier if the applicant has this pre-knowledge.
* This is where this mobile app How Do I? comes in.
